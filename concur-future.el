;;; concur-future.el --- Concurrency primitives for asynchronous tasks ---

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides concurrency primitives for handling asynchronous
;; tasks in Emacs. It integrates with `concur-promise` for promise-based
;; management of task resolution and rejection, and `concur-exec` for task
;; execution.
;;
;; This module introduces higher-level abstractions like futures, allowing
;; tasks to be executed concurrently while waiting for results without blocking
;; the main Emacs event loop. Futures provide a way to work with the result of
;; asynchronous tasks without directly using callbacks.
